## What is Jackal?

Jackal is a modern Tcl (Tool Command Language) interpreter implemented in Java. It is based on [JTcl](https://jtcl-project.github.io/jtcl/) and the earlier [Jacl](http://tcljava.sf.net) interpreter. Jackal aims for Tcl 8.4–compatible syntax and commands within the constraints of the JVM.

**Requirements:** Java 17 or higher (as configured in the project).
